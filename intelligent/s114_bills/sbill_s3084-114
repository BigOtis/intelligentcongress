The Department of Commerce Office of Security shall directly manage NIST's law enforcement and security programs through an assigned Director of Security for NIST.\n\nThe Office of Management and Budget shall establish an interagency working group to reduce administrative burdens of federally funded researchers while protecting the public's interest in the transparency of, and accountability for, federally funded activities.\n\nThe NSF, the Department of Education, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) shall establish the STEM Education Advisory Panel to advise the NSTC Committee on STEM Education on matters related to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).\n\nThe NSF shall award grants to:\n\n increase the participation of women and underrepresented groups in STEM fields, for research to advance the engagement of students in grades kindergarten through 8 in STEM, and for establishment of at least one Center of Excellence for the collection, maintenance, and dissemination of information to increase the participation of women and groups underrepresented in STEM fields. The National Institute of Standards and Technology Act is amended to revise requirements for:\n\n the NIST post-doctoral fellowship program, and the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership. Federal agencies may use crowdsourcing and voluntary, collaborative citizen science to advance their missions.\n\nThe Office of Science and Technology Policy shall establish an interagency working group to:\n\n summarize available research and best practices on how to promote diversity and inclusions in STEM fields, and examine whether barriers exist to promoting diversity and inclusion within federal agencies employing scientists and engineers. Each federal agency shall recommend to the President how it could expand research opportunities for undergraduate students attending institutions of higher education.\n\nThe NSF shall award grants for:\n\n research on computer science education and computational thinking; and Innovation Corps entrepreneurship and commercialization education, training, and mentoring."
