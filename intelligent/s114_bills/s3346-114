    "text": "National Aeronautics and Space Administration Transition Authorization Act of 2016\n\nTITLE I--AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS\n\n(Sec. 101) This bill authorizes appropriations to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for FY2017 for:\n\n exploration; space operations; science; aeronautics; space technology; education; safety, security, and mission services; construction and environmental compliance and restoration; and the NASA Inspector General. TITLE II--SUSTAINING NATIONAL SPACE COMMITMENTS\n\n(Sec. 201) Expresses the sense of Congress that NASA is and should remain a multimission agency with a balanced and robust set of core missions in science, space technology, aeronautics, human space flight and exploration, and education.\n\nTITLE III--MAXIMIZING UTILIZATION OF THE ISS AND LOW-EARTH ORBIT\n\n(Sec. 301) The bill expresses the sense of Congress that:\n\n NASA should continue to support the development of the Commercial Crew Program as planned to end reliance upon Russian transport of U.S. astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS); and the ISS should continue to provide a platform for fundamental, microgravity, discovery-based space life and physical sciences research. Congress reaffirms that it shall be U.S. policy, in consultation with its international partners in the ISS program, to support full and complete utilization of the ISS through at least 2024.\n\n(Sec. 302) The bill declares that it is U.S. policy that, in order to foster the competitive development, operation, improvement, and commercial availability of space transportation services, services for federal government access to and return from the ISS shall be procured by fair and open competition for well-defined, milestone-based, Federal Acquisition Regulation-based contracts.\n\nThe Commercial Orbital Transportation Services Program is renamed as the Commercial Resupply Services Program.\n\nNASA shall protect the safety of U.S. space crews by ensuring that commercial crew systems meet all applicable human rating requirements under specified federal law.\n\n(Sec. 303) NASA shall develop a plan for transitioning the ISS from the current regime that relies heavily on NASA sponsorship to a regime where NASA is one of many customers of a low-Earth orbit commercial human space flight enterprise.\n\nNASA shall submit triennial reports until 2023 which include:\n\n identification of the low-Earth orbit capabilities necessary to meet its deep space human flight exploration objectives and mission requirements beyond the period of operation and use of the ISS; steps NASA is taking and will take, including demonstrations that could be conducted on the ISS, to stimulate and facilitate commercial demand and supply of products and services in low-Earth orbit; an assessment of current and projected commercial activities in low-Earth orbit, including on the ISS, and their potential for meeting the capabilities identified; identification of barriers preventing the commercialization of low-Earth orbit; evaluation of the feasible and preferred service life of the ISS beyond September 30, 2024, through at least 2028, as a unique scientific, commercial, and exploration-related facility; evaluation of the functions, roles, and responsibilities for the management and operation of the ISS; and a description of the progress on meeting human exploration research objectives on the ISS and prospects for accomplishing future exploration and other research objectives on future commercially supplied low-Earth orbit platforms or migration of those objectives to cis-lunar space. The bill defines \"cis-lunar space\" as the region of space from the Earth out to and including the region around the surface of the Moon.\n\n(Sec. 304) Any contract between NASA and a provider (a person that provides domestic launch or domestic reentry services to the federal government) may provide that the United States will indemnify that provider against successful claims (including reasonable expenses of litigation or settlement) by third parties for death, bodily injury, or loss of or damage to property resulting from launch services and reentry services carried out under the contract that are defined in it as unusually hazardous or nuclear in nature, but only to the extent the total amount of successful claims related to the activities under that contract:\n\n is more than the amount of insurance or demonstration of financial responsibility, and is not more than $1.5 billion (plus additional amounts necessary to reflect inflation occurring after January 1, 1989) above such insurance or financial responsibility amount. A contract made under this section that provides indemnification shall provide for:\n\n notice to the United States of any claim or suit against the provider for death, bodily injury, or loss of or damage to property; and control of or assistance in the defense by the United States, at its election, of such claim or suit and approval of any settlement. A provider that has a contract with NASA under this section shall obtain liability insurance or demonstrate financial responsibility in amounts to compensate for the maximum probable loss from claims by:\n\n a third party for death, bodily injury, or property damage or loss resulting from a launch service or reentry service carried out under the contract; and the federal government for damage or loss to government property resulting from a launch service or reentry service carried out under such contract. NASA shall determine maximum probable losses within 90 days of the provider requesting such a determination and submitting all of the information that NASA requires. NASA may revise such a determination if the revision is warranted based on new information.\n\nFor the total claims related to one launch or reentry, a provider shall not be required to obtain insurance or demonstrate financial responsibility of more than:\n\n $500 million with respect to a third party, or $100 million with respect to the federal government; or the maximum liability insurance available on the world market at reasonable cost. An insurance policy or demonstration of financial responsibility regarding this section shall protect to the extent of their potential liability for involvement in launch services or reentry services:\n\n the federal government, federal government personnel, related entities of the federal government, related entities of the provider, and government astronauts (as defined in federal law). NASA may not indemnify a provider under this section until there is a cross-waiver between NASA and the provider.\n\nThe bill states that NASA shall reciprocally waive claims with a provider under which each party agrees to be responsible for damage or loss to its property, or for losses resulting from any injury or death sustained by its employees or agents. Such a waiver shall apply only to the extent that the claims are more than the amount of insurance or demonstration of financial responsibility.\n\nIndemnification under this section may exclude claims that result from the willfull misconduct of the provider or its related entities.\n\nNo payment may be made under this section unless NASA or its designee certifies that the amount is just and reasonable.\n\nNASA may not provide indemnification under this section for an activity requiring a license or permit under provisions relating to commercial space launch activities.\n\nTITLE IV--ADVANCING HUMAN DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION\n\nSubtitle Human Exploration Goals and Objectives\n\n(Sec. 411) The bill states that the long-terms goals for the human space flight and exploration efforts of NASA shall be:\n\n to expand permanent human presence beyond low-Earth orbit with the involvement of international, academic, and industry partners; and the peaceful settlement of a location in space or on another celestial body and a thriving space economy in the 21st century.

Subtitle B--Collaboration Among Mission Directorates and Other Matters\n\n(Sec. 621) NASA shall encourage an interdisciplinary approach among all NASA mission directorates and divisions for projects or missions to:\n\n improve coordination, and encourage collaboration and early planning on scope; determine areas of overlap or alignment; leverage across divisional perspectives to maximize outcomes; and be more efficient with resources and funds. (Sec. 622) NASA shall pursue a strategy for acquiring crewed transportation services and non-crewed launch services that continues to enhance communication, collaboration, and coordination between the Launch Services and Commercial Crew programs.\n\n(Sec. 623) NASA may enter into agreements with covered entities to provide them with space transportation infrastructure support and services, including to:\n\n maximize use of such infrastructure by the private sector, and encourage commercial space activities. Also, at such an entity's request, NASA may include in such an agreement that support and services in the contracted space launch and reentry range support requirements of NASA if:\n\n NASA determines that including that support and services in those requirements is in the best interest of the federal government, does not interfere with NASA requirements, does not compete with commercial space activities of other covered entities, and does not result in NASA retaining ownership of assets which are no longer needed to meet a programmatic mission of NASA; and any commercial requirement included in the agreement has full nonfederal funding before the implementation of the agreement. NASA may enter into an agreement with a covered entity on a cooperative and voluntary basis to accept funds, services, and equipment to carry out the purposes of this section.\n\nAny funds, services, or equipment accepted by NASA under this section:\n\n may be used only for the objectives specified in this section according to the terms of use set forth in the agreement, and shall be managed by NASA. An agreement entered into with a covered entity under this section shall:\n\n address the terms of use, ownership, and disposition of the funds, services, or equipment contributed under the agreement; include a provision that the covered entity will not recover the costs of its contribution through any other agreement with the United States; and include a provision that the contribution of the covered entity will not preclude access to or use by another covered entity. NASA shall submit annual reports to Congress on the process used to establish such agreements.\n\nThe bill defines \"covered entity\" as a nonfederal entity that:\n\n is organized under U.S. law or of any jurisdiction within the United States and is engaged in commercial space activities; or an entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, such a nonfederal entity. (Sec. 624) The bill expresses the sense of Congress that the presence of counterfeit electronic parts in NASA's supply chain poses a danger to astronauts, crew, and other NASA personnel and a risk to NASA overall.\n\nNASA shall revise specified regulations so as to improve the detection and avoidance of counterfeit electronic parts in its supply chain.\n\n(Sec. 625) NASA shall continue engagement with the public and educational opportunities for students using all NASA mission directorates.\n\nNASA shall report on its near-term outreach plans for advancing space law education.\n\n(Sec. 626) NASA shall identify orbital assets in specified mission directorates that could benefit from satellite servicing-related technologies and shall work across all NASA mission directorates to evaluate opportunities for the private sector to perform these services or advance technical capabilities by leveraging the technologies and techniques developed by NASA programs and other industry programs.\n\n(Sec. 627) In order to conduct necessary research, NASA shall continue, and as appropriate, consider expanding the development of technology payloads for scientific research and the investigation of new or improved capabilities.\n\nTo carry out such purpose, NASA shall make funds available for flight testing, payload development, and hardware related to such research and investigation.\n\nCongress reaffirms that NASA should provide flight opportunities for payloads to microgravity environments and suborbital altitudes.\n\n(Sec. 628) The bill expresses the sense of Congress on specified small class launch missions."
